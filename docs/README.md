# Documentation

The documentation set will mirror the course requirements:
- `architecture/` — diagrams (UML use cases, logical DB, structural schemes)
- `specs/` — narrative sections for the explanatory note

Supporting assets (screens, exports from draw.io, etc.) will be stored in the respective subfolders.
